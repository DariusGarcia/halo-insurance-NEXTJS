                      Halo is a licensed insurance agency not an insurance

                      by the party listing the insurance policy, and Halo
                      Insurance. The terms and conditions of any insurance
                      product offered to you are provided by the Providers based
                      on their underwriting and may vary based on a number of
                      factors solely as determined by the insurers. We don’t

                      that appear on our website or other communication
                      channels. As a result, it is your sole discretion whether
                      to take out a policy based on a quote you get through our
                      Service and to make sure the policy that is of interest to
                      you meets your specific needs.

                      and whether they are the most current quotes available.
                      The quotes do not constitute bookable rates, as the actual
                      bookable rate requires additional information from you,
